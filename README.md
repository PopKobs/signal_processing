dot product of sinusoids.ipynb explores the theory of how all waves like sound can be represented as a sum of sinusoids.

signal generation processing.ipynb looks at using fourier transform to analyse the frequencies present in an audio signal & the use of spectrograms to visualise the magnitude of each frequency component in the signal.
